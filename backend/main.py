"""
FuncMons leaderboard API.

Mirrors the scoring rules in ../leaderboard.js exactly — keep both in sync
if either changes:

  Round 1 (matching)   score = moves*10 + seconds
  Round 2 (sorting)    score = seconds*10 + mistakes
  Overall              score = round1Score + round2Score

Unlike the localStorage placeholder (which trusts the client's own
computation), this server ALWAYS recomputes every score itself from the raw
moves/seconds/mistakes a client submits — a Round 2 submission's overall
score is round2's own score plus the student's most recent Round 1 result
already on file, never a client-supplied number. Some cheap sanity bounds
(moves >= pairs, a minimum plausible time per pair) reject the laziest fake
submissions too. None of this is airtight — nothing server-side can fully
verify gameplay the server never observed — but it closes the trivial
"POST any number you like" hole.

The Overall leaderboard is aggregated per student: best score, with a
capped bonus for repeat play within the past week (-5/session, capped at
-25). All-time shows best score ever, no bonus.

Runs as an Azure Function (see function_app.py) via the ASGI adapter, so
this file itself is just a plain FastAPI app — nothing Azure-specific here
except how the database connection is obtained (db.py).
